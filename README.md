# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue with Large Font Sizes

This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS with larger font sizes (specifically, `text-9xl` in this example).  Despite seemingly correct configuration and class name usage, the styles fail to apply.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when attempting to use Tailwind's `text-9xl` utility class. The expected large font size does not render; instead, the text retains the default browser styling.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies (Tailwind CSS and React).
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.

## Expected Behavior
The text "Hello Tailwind!" should render with a very large font size as defined by the `text-9xl` utility class.

## Actual Behavior
The text renders with the default browser font size. The Tailwind style is not applied.

## Solution
The solution involves checking for conflicts with custom CSS or other plugins that may override Tailwind's styles.  In the provided solution, we ensure no other conflicting styles are overriding the Tailwind CSS classes.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter similar issues with other Tailwind classes, ensure that:

* Your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly set up and includes your content path.
* You have correctly imported Tailwind into your CSS file.
* There are no conflicting styles from other CSS or plugins that might be overriding your Tailwind classes.
